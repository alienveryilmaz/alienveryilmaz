## 🧠 About Me

- 📍 Based in **Munich, Germany**
- 🧑‍💻 **IT Lead / Mobile Engineer**
- 🤖 **AI Engineer** (LLMs, Fine-tuning, RAG, AI Workflows)
- 📱 **React Native Specialist**
- 🧩 I design **algorithmic systems** that understand people (tests, matching, personality & behavior)

## 🚀 What I Do
I’ve worked on projects across different domains, including software development, system design, and artificial intelligence, with a strong focus on building real-world, production-ready systems.
### 🤖 Artificial Intelligence
Below are **two production-level AI systems** that I chose to **highlight** as representative examples of my AI-focused work:
> Live product access and system-level explanations are available in the repository.

- ✅ **Fine-tuned LLMs** for domain-specific behavior  
- ✅ **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** systems  
- ✅ **Custom AI workflows** (multi-step reasoning, context memory, decision flow)
- ✅ AI that **talks differently to each user** based on personality & relationship context

A fully custom dating platform built with **React Native**, featuring:
> The repository includes Figma designs and product-level implementation details.

- 🧪 Personality & compatibility **tests**
- 📊 A **custom matching algorithm** that calculates user-specific compatibility scores
- 🤖 An **AI relationship assistant** that talks personally to each user
